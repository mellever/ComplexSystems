# ComplexSystems
Repository for the third introduction to complex systems assignment. For the first simulation the Python code has been used, however it turned out this was way to slow for the bonus question. For this question the c++ file gen_data.cpp has been used compiled with g++ gen_data.cpp -O3 -ffast-math -fopenmp. The data obtained from this program in then plotted by the plot.py program.
